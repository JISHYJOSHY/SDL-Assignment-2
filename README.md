# SDL-Assignment-2
University Assignment involving SDL and OpenGL. Physics based scenarios planned

Not sure what will be included here, probably just stuff I think of relating to physics.
Will mostly revolve around a game of Pool though.

Would've made this private but Git declined my request for a student account :(
